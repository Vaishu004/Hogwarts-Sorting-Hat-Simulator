# 🧙‍♂️ Sorting Hat Simulator

> *"There's nothing hidden in your head the Sorting Hat can't see..."* 🎶

Hey there, fellow Potterheads! ⚡  
This one's for all of us who spent way too much time wondering which Hogwarts house we'd truly belong in. 🏰  
I built this fun little simulator that sorts *you* into a house based on an interactive quiz — complete with webcam magic, the iconic Sorting Hat, and Hedwig’s Theme playing in the background for full wizarding vibes.

So grab your wand (or webcam 😄) and let the sorting begin!

 ✨ Features
- A fun quiz 
- Face detection using OpenCV
- Sorting Hat image overlay on user's head (via webcam)
- Hedwig's Theme playing in background
- Text-to-speech house announcement using pyttsx3

- PyTTSx3
- NumPy
- PIL (Pillow)
- Pygame (for background music)
